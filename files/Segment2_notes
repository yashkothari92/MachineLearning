	Fundamental Law of Active Portfolio Management
	(Grindol's fundametal law) 
	performance = skill * sqrt(breadth)
	----------------------------------
	IR 	    = IC    * sqrt(breadth)
	----------------------------------
	[ IR, Information Ratio = 
			mean(alpha_p(t) / stdev(alpha_p(t) ]
	[ IC, Information Co-efficient = 
			correlation of the manager's forecast to actual returns
			for eg, If s/he predicts IBM would go up 1%, and it went up 0.5% it's a positive correlation
			This value can range from 0 (where correlation is not present) to 1 (where its very very strong)]
